        <p>
          <br>I'm a Frontend Web Developer currently located in Vevey, Switzerland.
          <br>
          <br>I worked in the beauty industry as a hair stylist. I worked in Miami, Los Angeles, and Lausanne. After spending some time working at a hair color startup called eSalon, my interest sparked for web development.
          <br>
          <br>I finished Le Wagon Full Stack boot camp in April 2021. During my time there I totally got passionate about Frontend web development. I love the thrill of constructing a great looking site! I am always looking for an opportunity to get experience to grow in my Frontend capabilities.
          <br>
          <br> When I am not furthering my knowledge in code, you'll find me outside getting myself onto the mountains by hike or climb! I bring my pup Ruthie a long as much as possible on my little adventures outdoors.
