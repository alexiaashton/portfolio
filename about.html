        <p>
          <br>I'm a Frontend Web Developer currently located in Vevey, Switzerland.
          <br>
          <br>I had a career in the beauty industry as a hair stylist previously. I worked in Miami, Los Angeles, and Lausanne. When living in Los Angeles, I spent some time as a colorist and doing customer care at the hair color startup <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.esalon.com/" target="_blank">eSalon</a>. It was during this time that my interest began to spark for web development.
          <br>

          <br>I finished <a class=hyperlink href="https://www.lewagon.com/lausanne" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a>'s 9-week Full Stack boot camp in April 2021. During my time there I totally became passionate about Frontend web development. I love the thrill of constructing a great looking site! Since completing the boot camp, I have continued to work on improving my skills. I am always looking for any opportunity to get experience to grow in my capabilities.
          <br>
          <br> When I am not furthering my knowledge in code, you'll find me outside getting myself onto the mountains by hike or climb! I bring my pup Ruthie along as much as possible on my little adventures outdoors.
